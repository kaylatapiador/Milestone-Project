# Milestone-Project
/*This project is a webgame version of Skip-bo. Skip-bo is a card game that can be played between 2-6 players. 
In this version the user plays against the computer by inputting how many AI's they want to play against. 
This game is similar to Soiltare as players lay cards onto a pile in an ascending order, but it is a race to see who can run out of cards first.

Rules of the game: 
Each player gets a deck of either 20 or 30 cards (depending how many players are playing). This deck is what they need to get rid of in order to become the winner of the game. 

In the center area of play right near the DRAW pile, up to four BUILDING piles will be created for all players to use during play. In addition, each player will have in front of them a STOCK pile and up to 4 discard piles. (Building and discard piles are developed through play and no cards should be in this area at the beginning of the game.)

# Milestone-Project
/*This project is a webgame version of Skip-bo. Skip-bo is a card game that can be played between 2-6 players. 
In this version the user plays against the computer by inputting how many AI's they want to play against. 
This game is similar to Soiltare as players lay cards onto a pile in an ascending order, but it is a race to see who can run out of cards first.

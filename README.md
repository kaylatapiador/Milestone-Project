# Milestone-Project
/*This project is a webgame version of battleship using HTML,CSS, and JavScript. The layout of this game will feature a 10x10 board where each player has four ships.
Prior to the game starting each player must place their ship either horizontally or vertically. In addition, the user is also not allowed to place their ships next to each other and there must be at least a space in between ships.
The game begins by the user entering their "target" in which it can either "hit" the opponents ship or miss. If the player missed then it is the next user's turn to find the opponents ship. However, if a player does hit
a ship their turn continues until they miss.
The winner of this game gets determined when the user has sunk all their opponents ship.
